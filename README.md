# 🏨 Hotel Management System in C

This is a **console-based Hotel Management System** developed using **C programming**. It allows both **Admin** and **Customer** roles with separate access levels, enabling seamless room management, customer booking, billing, and support functionalities.

This project was built as part of the academic learning at Emertxe Information Technologies under the guidance and support of experienced faculty and peers
## 🔧 Features

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

| Tool/Tech        | Purpose                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **C Language**   | Core development                    |
| **GCC Compiler** | Compilation                         |
| **VS Code**      | Primary IDE (optional)              |
| **Linux/Windows Terminal** | Run and test the executable     |
| **File I/O**     | Storing customer, room, and booking data |
| **Modular Design** | Each feature is implemented in separate `.c/.h` files |

## 💡 How to Run

```bash
gcc *.c -o hotel
./hotel
```
##  Challenges Faced

● Structuring a large C project into multiple files

● Handling file I/O for both reading and writing multiple types of data

● Validating user inputs (dates, phone numbers, usernames)

● Generating unique IDs and reloading counters

● Preventing duplicate room numbers and usernames

● Calculating the number of days between two dates using time.h

● Ensuring modularity, readability, and maintainability
##  🌟 Future Enhancements

Here are some planned upgrades that can enhance the system further:

● GUI Integration using C GUI libraries (GTK or even Python-Tkinter wrapper)

● Admin Dashboard Reports: Daily/weekly booking and revenue reports

● Booking History for customers

● Feedback System: Collect ratings after checkout

● Coupon/Discount System

● Online Payment Simulation

● Multi-language support

● Database Integration (e.g., SQLite instead of text files)

● Login Attempt Limiter: Lock user after 3 failed attempts

##  🎓 What I Learned
● Structuring large-scale C projects

● Modular programming and header file usage

● Working with structures and arrays of structures

● Handling date and time in C

● Implementing file handling for persistence

● Validation of real-world inputs (phone, date, password)

● Project planning and feature implementation step by step

● Debugging and testing in C environment
